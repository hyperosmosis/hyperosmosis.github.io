Hello! I am currently a fourth PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. Advised by [Dr. Michael Wu](https://research.fhcrc.org/wu/en.html), I am broadly interested in developing methods for the analysis of microbiome data using the kernel framework. Previously, I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2017, where I majored in Statistics and Biochemistry.

In addition to my dissertation work, I am a research assistant in Dr. Julia Yue Cui's group. In collaboration with the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, I am the principal data analyst on a project characterizing the basal microbiome composition during development of subjects age 1 to 12. 3. The results of this study will be the first to characterize how the microbiome changes and develops over time in a healthy individual. Although researchers will gain much insight from our project, clinicians can also use this information and diagnose patients based on deviations in their patient’s microbiome.

In my free time, I enjoy figuring out how to cook everything from my CSA box, trying to knit sweaters and hiking in the PNW. I'm also always interested in colloborating on various different projects so feel free to contact me if you have an interesting project!
